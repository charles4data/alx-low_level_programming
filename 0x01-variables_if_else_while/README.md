# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

**These tasks are for creating programs in C that perform different tasks. A short description of what each program does is provided below:**
-----------------------------------------
*Task 0-positive_or_negative.c:*
+ The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. I have completed the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
-----------------------------------------------
*Task 1-last_digit.c:*
+ The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. I have completed the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
-----------------------------------------------
*Task 2-print_alphabet.c:*
+ The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. I was only allowed to use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). I was required to include all my code in the main function. Further, I was required t only use putchar twice in my code.
-----------------------------------------------
*Task 3-print_alphabets.c:*
+ The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. I could only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). I was required to put all my code in the main function and only use putchar three times.
---------------------------------------------------
*Task 4-print_alphabt.c:*
+ The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. It print all the letters except q and e. Like before, I was required to use only the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). The instructions also suggested that I should put my code inside the main function and only use putchar twice.
---------------------------------------------------------
*Task 5-print_numbers.c:*
+ The program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. All my code was to be in the main function.
------------------------------------------------------
*Task 6-print_numberz.c:*
+ The program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.The requirements did not allow the use any variable of type char. I could only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). Lasty, I could only use putchar twice in my code and all the code was to be in the main function.
-------------------------------------------------------------
*Task 7-print_tebahpla.c:*
+ The program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. When writing this program, I was expected to only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). I was also required to put all my code in the main function and only use putchar twice in the code.
-----------------------------------------------------
*Task 8-print_base16.c:*
+ The program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. I was required to only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). I was also required to put all my code in the main function and only use putchar thrice in the code.
-----------------------------
*Task 9-print_comb.c:*
+ The program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space ` `. Numbers should be printed in ascending order. The instructions requred that I only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). All my code is in the main function. I could only use putchar four times maximum in my code and I was not allowed to use any variable of type char.`
---------------------------------
*Task 100-print_comb3.c:*
+ The program prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. The two digits must be different. 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1. Print only the smallest combination of two digits. Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. All your code should be in the main function.
