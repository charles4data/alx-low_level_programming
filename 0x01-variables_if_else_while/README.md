# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

**These tasks are for creating programs in C that perform different tasks. A short description of what each program does is provided below:**
-----------------------------------------
*Task 0-positive_or_negative.c:*
+ The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. I have completed the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
-----------------------------------------------
*Task 1-last_digit.c:*
+ The program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. I have completed the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
-----------------------------------------------
*Task 2-print_alphabet.c:*
+ The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. I was only allowed to use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). I was required to include all my code in the main function. Further, I was required t only use putchar twice in my code.
-----------------------------------------------
*Task 3-print_alphabets.c:*
+ The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. I could only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). I was required to put all my code in the main function and only use putchar three times.
---------------------------------------------------
*Task 4-print_alphabt.c:*
+ The program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. It print all the letters except q and e. Like before, I was required to use only the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). The instructions also suggested that I should put my code inside the main function and only use putchar twice.
---------------------------------------------------------
*Task 5-print_numbers.c:*
+ The program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. All my code was to be in the main function.
------------------------------------------------------
*Task 6-print_numberz.c:*
+ The program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.The requirements did not allow the use any variable of type char. I could only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). Lasty, I could only use putchar twice in my code and all the code was to be in the main function.
-------------------------------------------------------------
*7-print_tebahpla.c:*
+The program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. When writing this program, I was expected to only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). I was also required to put all my code in the main function and only use putchar twice in the code.
-----------------------------------------------------
*8-print_base16.c:*
+ The program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. I was required to only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) was forbidden). I was also required to put all my code in the main function and only use putchar thrice in the code.
