# ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING
Tasks in this repository relate to final solutions for the completed tasks for alx software engineering bootcamp. The sections are outlined and briefly described as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------
## 0x00-hello_world Tasks
+ Introduction to c programming and writing the first code.
-----------------------------------------------------
## 0x01-variables_if_else_while Tasks
+ These tasks focus on variables, if_else statements, and while loops in c programming
------------------------------------------------------
## 0x02-functions_nested_loops Tasks
+ Increased focus in this case was on functions and nested loops as used in c programming
----------------------------------------------------------
## 0x03-debugging Tasks
+ In this section, we were/are introduced to debugging in c programming - what it is, how it originated, how to identify errors, and how to address them manually.
---------------------------------------------------------
## 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops Tasks
+ This is a continuation of the previous tasks of the same name. We did some advanced practice on functions and nested loops in c
---------------------------------------------------------
## 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
+ Here, I worked on tasks related to the Pointers, strings, and arrays, especially how to manipulate them
---------------------------------------------------------
## 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
+ Additional tasks on pointers, strings, and arrays, especially how to manipulate and work with them.
